## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](design/project.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox or other browser to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

I learned a lot more about the box model and aligning objects horizontally to eachother. I also learned how to work with wrapping and making the site mobile proof with percent margins.    


```html
    <div class="container">
         
          <div class="container1">
            <img src="../images/image-colton.jpg" class="colton"> <p> <br> <span class="namecolton"> Colton Smith </span><br>
            <span class="vb">Verified Buyer</span> <br> <br> <br>
            "We needed the same printed design as the one we had ordered a week prior.
            Not only did they find the original order, but we also received it in time.
            Excellent!" </p> 
          </div>
          <div class="container2">
            <img src="../images/image-irene.jpg" class="colton"> <p> <br> <span class="nameirene"> Irene Roberts </span><br>
            <span class="vb">Verified Buyer</span> <br> <br> <br>
            "Customer service is always excellent and very quick turn around. Completely
            delighted with the simplicity of the purchase and the speed of delivery." </p> 
          </div>
          <div class="container3">
            <img src="../images/image-anne.jpg" class="colton"> <p> <br> <span class="nameanne"> Anne Wallace </span><br>
            <span class="vb">Verified Buyer</span> <br> <br> <br>
            "Put an order with this company and can only praise them for the very high
            standard. Will definitely use them again and recommend them to everyone!"</p> 
          </div>
```
```css
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap; 

body { margin: 10%;}
```


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

I want to learn more about boxes and display settings in html. I was able to get a general understanding of horizontal alignments.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Helped me understand the box model and proper alignments.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Also helped me understand the box model and proper alignments.
