## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./project.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox or other browser to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [League Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/League+Spartan) - For styles



### What I learned

I learned a lot more about the box model and aligning objects horizontally to eachother. I also learned how to work with wrapping and making the cite mobile proof with percent margins.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:       
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap; 

body { margin: 10%;}

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

I want to learn more about boxes and display settings in html. I was able to get a general understanding of horizontal alignments.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Helped me understand the box model and proper alignments.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Also helped me understand the box model and proper alignments.
